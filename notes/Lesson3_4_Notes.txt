Lesson 3: Building Up

	Designing Page Layouts to be Responsive
	Design pattern is more art then science
	
	Media Queries: Different style for sifferent devices
		wider then n pixels
			@media screen and (min-width:500px){
				...changes
			}
		
		smaller then n pixels
			@media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
				...changes
`			}
		Define breakpoints based on content not devices
			Find dont choose breakpoints
		
			1. Start Small
			2. Watch for too much space as it grows
			3. Adjust fonts for size changes
	
Lesson 4: Common Responsive Patterns	

	Design Patterns
		Grid Fluid System
			columns wrap to next line as browser width gets smaller
			bootstrap or 960 grid layout system
			html5rocks.com
		Flexbox
			Ability to fill space available (elements can grow or shrink)
			display: flex;
				default flex direction is row
			flex-wrap: wrap 
				lets elements wrap to next line
			css order atribute to change order of elements
				order: #
				default order value is 0
				-1 is first
				anything > 0 is last
				

		Column Drop
		Mostly Fluid
		Layout Shifter
			Most responsive
			multiple breakpoints
			content moves relay on order
			needs more planning
		Off Canvas
			less frequently used content is placed off screen unless 
				screen is large enough
			uses hamburger menu

			nav id="drawer" //off canvas nav
				width: 300px;
				height: 100%
				position: absolute;
				transform: translate(-300px, 0); //moves nav off screen
				transition: transform 0.3s ease; //transition as it is brought in
			nav.open { 
				transform: translate(0, 0) } // opens navbar by resetting transform

			menu.addEventListener( 'click', function(e) {
				drawer.classList.toggle('open');
				e.stopPropagation();
			});


			other way:
				nav { 
					width: 300px;
					height: 100%;
					--webkit-transform: translate(-300px, 0);
					transform: translate(-300px, 0);
					transition: transform 0.3s ease;
				}

				nav.open {
					--webkit-transform: translate(0,0);
					transform: translate(0, 0)
